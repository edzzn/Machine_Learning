# Artificial Neurons
__Neurons__ are interconnected nerve cells in the brain that are involved in the processing of chemical and electrical signals.

The first concep of a simplified neuron for the design of artificial intelligence was proposed by  McCullochâ€“Pitts (MCP).
Their model is the __(MCP) neuron__.

This neuron is considered as the unit of measure. It is the base of neural networks.

MCP neuron is a simple logic gate with __binary outputs__. Multiple signals arrive at the dendrites, are integrated into the cell body, and, if the accumulated signal exceedsa certain threshold, an output signal is generated.
