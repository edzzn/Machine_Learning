# SVM - Support Vector Machine

## What is Support Vector Machine?
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification and regression challenges. It is mostly used for classification.
 
In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then we perform a classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes.

Support Vectors are the coordinates of individual observations. 
## How does it work?
SVM selects the hyper-plane which classifies the classes accurately prior to maximizing the margin.
